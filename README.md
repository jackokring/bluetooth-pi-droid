==================

Raspberry Pi and Android Bluetooth Connectivity. The pi side is a demon and some scripts to automatically connect to bluetooth. The android side is a service application to provide touchscreen, sensors, IME text and a scripted remote. If the pi and android are not connected, the android services are simulated on the pi, and the internal script library can be run on the android.
